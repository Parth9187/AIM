    "\n",
    "- Repeatable: the code can be easily run again and you can reuse the same steps in different situations\n",
    "- Understandable: If you analyze in the code, the code will tell you what to do. While it's not perfect, it's still better than looking at plain python\n",

    "- Edit mode (let's write in cells and edit them)\n",

    "Escape takes you into command mode (a blue bar to the left of the highlighted cell) and Enter takes you to edit mode (a green bar to the left of the highlighted cell).\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are buttons at the top, I highly recommend learning shortcuts. Besides these two, the most important ones are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Command Mode:**\n",
    "- a: create a cell above\n",
    "- b: create a cell below\n",
    "- Cmd/Ctrl+Enter - Runs a cell\n",
    "- dd: deletes a cell (be careful, you can't undo this)\n",
    "- m: Set a cell to text mode (markdown), like this cell you're reading\n",
    "- y: Set a cell to code mode (the default)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Edit mode:**\n",
    "- shift+tab: show documentation for the function the cursor is inside. Hit tab multiple times to change where the documentation pop-up appears. (sometimes won't trigger in which case just google \"pandas documentation x\")\n"
